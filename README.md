## Usage

This plugin adds options on Archive admin pages for the Genesis Framework. Once the plugin has been activated you can specify the number of posts per page, how you prefer posts to be ordered by (date, title, etc.), whether to have posts in ascending or descending order, whether to display the full content, a content limit or the excerpt and options to control the featured image size and alignment. Additional options will be added in the near future.

## Issues

This software is considered to be in beta stage and for evaluation use only. Do not use in a production site at this time.
